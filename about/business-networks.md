# Business Networks (Consortiums)

For Corda, Business Networks are groups of companies who wish to transact together - using either Corda Open Source or  Enterprise, for a specific commercial purpose. 

Business Networks can have many different governance models. Business Networks using Corda can range from a consortium model, to a more centralized model with a Business Network Operator (which may be a separate legal entity). A BNO often sets-up and operates legal rules, organisation structure and business processes for its Business Network. They may also design and operate a shared CorDapp for the Business Networkâ€™s members to transact with, or this can also be set-up and run by a third party. A BNO may ask its participants to sign legal agreements directly with the Foundation (prior to joining the Network), or may act as a Sponsor for its participants.

Depending on their size, Business Networks may also wish to onboard, offboard and bill their members - see the [Business Network Membership Service](https://github.com/corda/corda-solutions/tree/master/bn-apps/memberships-management)

We continue to develop tools and features for Business Networks to work well. Please visit the [Business Networks Toolkit](/about/businessnetworkstoolkit).

R3 also have a detailed [solutions site](https://solutions.corda.net/business-networks/intro.html) on the options and flexibility which Business Networks can offer while using Corda.
