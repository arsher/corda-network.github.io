# Choosing the node's X500 name

Any node on Corda Network must have a Distinguished Name (DN) or X500 name in its [participation certificate](https://docs.corda.net/corda-network/index.html#identity-service). This must, at minimum, have 4 fields included (Organisation (O), Locality (L), Country (C), Organisation Unit (OU)). It may include up to 6 fields (optional 2 additional fields are: State (S), and Common Name(CN)). These 6 fields are explained below. For now, the maximum number of characters  in the whole x500 name (across all 6 fields) is **128 characters**.

A X500 must be unique within Corda Network. The combination of O and OU are used for the uniqueness check, and the other fields are considered as attributes of the identity. 

All data fields must adhere to the following constraints:
* Only uses Latin, common and inherited unicode scripts
* Upper-case first letter
* At least two letters
* No leading or trailing whitespace
* Does not include the following characters: , , = , $ , " , ' , \
* Is in NFKC normalization form
* Does not contain the null character

Organisation (O) must represent a legal entity name - which is the beneficial owner of states on the ledger. For guidance on what exact legal entity name to write, see [here](/participation/legalentity)

Overall, the DN is one of the most common points of error in joining Corda Network, so take care to fill this out correctly. As part of standard onboarding checks for Corda Network, the Identity Operator may verify that these details have been accurately populated and reject requests where the population of these fields does not appear to be correct.

May not contain the words "node" or "server". | The O field for the legal entity defines the beneficial owner of states on the ledger. This should be set to the **legal name** of the organisation, as it appears on the official trade register within the jurisdiction in which the entity is registered. This is used to define the owning organisation of the node / certificate.               |
